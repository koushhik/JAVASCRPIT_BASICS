<!--IMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS:
    
  HERE YOU DONT NEED TO DECLIRE SCRIPT TAG AS IT IS A BASIC FUNCTION OF HTML. AND EXTENSION REMAINS SAME (anyfilename.html)

 1)WE CAN CHANGE THE STYLING ELEMNTS OF A PARTICULAR HTML ELEMNTS THROUGH JAVA SCRIPT
 2) WE USE style.display for changing styling of display of attributes.
 3)to change the STYLING OF ATTRIBUTE PARAGRAPH ....WE ACESS THE JS THROUGH ID OF PARAGRAPH.
 4)TO REVEAL THE CONTENT OF PARAGRAPH ...WE FIRST ACESSS ID AND HIDE THE ELEMNETS THAT NEEDS TO BE REVEALED USING CSS BY:
 document.getElementById with id name same as paragraph ('disp_reveal')

 5) here in the paragraph along with id we also modify style as hidden by:
   
 <p id="disp_reveal" style="display: none">paragrpah to be revealed for now remains hidden </p>

 5)for STYLE CHANGES WE DECLAIRE :
  .style.display='block'

  here,
   'block' is the keyword for revealing the hidden the content.
