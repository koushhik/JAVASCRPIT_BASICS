<!--IMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS:
    
  HERE YOU DONT NEED TO DECLIRE SCRIPT TAG AS IT IS A BASIC FUNCTION OF HTML. AND EXTENSION REMAINS SAME (anyfilename.html)

  1)HERE WE ACESS THE PARAGRAPH USING ID TAG.
  2)THE GOAL IS TO CHANGE CONTENT OF PRAGRAPH <P>
    2.1) ID DECLAIRED IS "CHANGE" YOU CAN DECLAIRE ANY ID.
    2.2) YOU ADD A SHORT PARAGHAPH STATING THAT "CONTENT WILL BE CHANGED"...OR SOMETHING RELEVANT.
  3)HERE IN BUTTON TAG WE DECLIRE TYPE AS "button" AND document.getElemnetById('id name').innerHTML = '<MESSAGE TO BE DISPLAYED>'
    4)ID IS THE SAME ONE YOU DECLIRED FOR THE PARAGRAPH.
    5)getElementById denotes to access the id by the name decliared.
    6).innerHTML = will tell the message that needs to be declaired upon button click.
    7)<MESSAGE TO BE DISPLAYED> IS ANY TEXT FIELD WIHEREIN THE MESSAGE NEEDS TO BE PRINTED.
