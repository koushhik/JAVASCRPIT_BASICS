<!--IMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS:
    
  HERE YOU DONT NEED TO DECLIRE SCRIPT TAG AS IT IS A BASIC FUNCTION OF HTML. AND EXTENSION REMAINS SAME (anyfilename.html)

 1)WE CAN CHANGE THE STYLING ELEMNTS OF A PARTICULAR HTML ELEMNTS THROUGH JAVA SCRIPT
 2) OFFCOUSE IN CSS WE CAN CHANGE THE STYLE SUCH AS COLOR . THE DIFFERENCE IS:
    2.1) IN CSS WE DECLAIRE THE STYLES DURING THE INITIAL CODING PROCESS.
    2.2)IN JAVASCRIPT WE CAN CHANGE DYNAMICALLY BY AN EVENT LIKE...CLICK OF A BUTTON
    2.3) IN CSS WE USE FOR INILINE STYLING : 
       
    ex: <p style="color:red;">paragraph to red </p>

    2.4) IN JAVASCRIPT WE USE:

    ex: onclick="document.getElementById('idname').style.color='red'"
       here,
        style is the keyword followed by . with attribute you want to chaange = 'attribute value'
 3)we then declaire id where changes needs to be seen upon click.
