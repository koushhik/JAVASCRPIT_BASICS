###JAVASCRIPT : While Html is used fro creating the structure of the webpage, Css for styling . JavaScript is used for creating Dynamic content in the web pages like the working of buttons, what must be done upone clicking, changing colors of the carasol etc .

practicing the java script concepts from basics to advanced.

YOU ARE ABSOLUTLEY FREE TO CONTRIBUTRE TO THIS REPOSITORY : ALTHOUGH THIS IS A PRACTICE AND DOCUMNETATION OF MY LEARNINGS FOR DEV LOG PURPOSES, TO COME AND REVISIT FOR BASIC REVISION.You are free to colloborate as well.

1)I TRY MY BEST TO EXECUTE PROGRAM , CHECK FOR PROPER OUTPUT AND THEN COMMIT INTO REPOSITORY,

if by chance you encounter an error in your local device then chances are since,:

-> MOST OF THE FILES IN THIS REPOSITORIES ARE SAVED AS .js FORMAT ...KINDLY RENAME THE FILE INTO .html FORMAT UNLESS STATED TO USE .js FORMAT
   THIS IS DONE FOR LANGUAGE DISPLAY OF JAVSCRIPT IN GITHUB STYLING OF REPOSITORY SO YOU DONT NEED TO FOLLOW THAT.
   
-> IF YOU ARE EXECUTING USING YOUR LOCAL TEXT EDITOR SUCH AS : SUBLIME TEXT, ATOM,VISUAL STUDIO etc.
   (press CTRL+S and name file as :newprog.html) that should do the trick. OR anyname of your choice ending with .html.

2)IF YOU WANT DETAILED EXPLAINATION OF CODE WHICH I TRY TO ADD ....JUST HOVER OVER THE SECOND ROW OF CODE LIKE THIS :

3)IN VISUAL STUDIO THE PROGRAM SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS :(if you have saved it as .html that is)
